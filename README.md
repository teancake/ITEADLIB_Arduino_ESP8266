# ESP8266 UART wifi library for Arduino #
This library was forked from <https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_ESP8266>, which is marked as been discarded. The only purpose that I forked it here is that one of my projects used a modified version of this libarry and I need to have a record of it. This modified version of the library is intended for arduino pro mino, connecting with the ESP8266 module with the hardware UART at 57600 baud rate. 

For those who are interested in ESP8266 development, I do recommend this extension for the arduino IDE, in which the ESP8266 can be programmed directly. <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino>
