# ESP8266 UART wifi library for Arduino #
This library was forked from <https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_ESP8266>, which was marked as been discarded. The only purpose that I forked it here is that one of my projects used a modified version of this libarry and I need to have a record of it. This modified version of the library is intended for Arduino Pro Mini (3.3V-8MHz), connected to the ESP8266 module through the hardware UART at 57600 baud rate. 

For those who are interested in ESP8266 development, I do recommend this extension for the arduino IDE <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino>, in which the ESP8266 module can be programmed directly.
